- Reduced verbose logging in RDPDR module (now uses tracing::debug/trace)

### Fixed
- Pinned sspi to 0.16.0 and picky to 7.0.0-rc.16 to avoid rand_core conflicts

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- Tree view state persistence (expanded/collapsed folders saved between sessions)
- Native format (.rcn) import/export with proper group hierarchy preservation

### Fixed
- RDP embedded mode window sizing now uses saved window geometry
- Sidebar reload now preserves expanded/collapsed state
- Group hierarchy correctly maintained during native format import

### Changed
- Dependencies updated:
  - `ksni` 0.2 → 0.3 (with blocking feature)
  - `resvg` 0.44 → 0.45
  - `dirs` 5.0 → 6.0
  - `criterion` 0.5 → 0.6
- Migrated from deprecated `criterion::black_box` to `std::hint::black_box`

### Removed
- Removed obsolete TODO comment and unused variable in window.rs

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-01
