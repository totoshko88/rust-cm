## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- Native SPICE protocol embedding using `spice-client` crate 0.2.0 (optional `spice-embedded` feature)
  - Direct framebuffer rendering without external processes
  - Keyboard and mouse input forwarding via Inputs channel
  - Automatic fallback to external viewer (remote-viewer, virt-viewer, spicy) when native fails
  - Note: Clipboard and USB redirection not yet available in native mode (crate limitation)
- Real-time connection status indicators in the sidebar (green/red dots) to show connected/disconnected state
- Support for custom cursors in RDP sessions (server-side cursor updates)
- Full integration of "Expect" automation engine:
  - Regex-based pattern matching on terminal output
  - Automatic response injection
  - Support for "one-shot" triggers
- Terminal improvements:
  - Added context menu (Right-click) with Copy, Paste, and Select All options
  - Added keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+C (Copy) and Ctrl+Shift+V (Paste)
- Refactored `Connection` model to support extensible automation configuration (`AutomationConfig`)

### Changed
- Updated `thiserror` from 1.0 to 2.0 (backwards compatible, no API changes required)
- Note: `picky` remains pinned at `=7.0.0-rc.17` due to sspi 0.16.0 incompatibility with newer versions

### Removed
- Unused FFI mock implementations for RDP and SPICE protocols (`rustconn-core/src/ffi/rdp.rs`, `rustconn-core/src/ffi/spice.rs`)
- Unused RDP and SPICE session widget modules (`rustconn/src/session/rdp.rs`, `rustconn/src/session/spice.rs`)

### Fixed
- Connection status indicator disappearing when closing one of multiple sessions for the same connection (now tracks session count per connection)
- System tray menu intermittently not appearing (reduced lock contention and debounced D-Bus updates)

## [0.4.2] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed
- Asbru-CM import now correctly parses installed Asbru configuration (connections inside `environments` key)
- Application icon now properly resolves in all installation scenarios (system, Flatpak, local, development)

### Changed
- Icon theme search paths extended to support multiple installation methods

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- IronRDP audio backend (RDPSND) with PCM format support (48kHz, 44.1kHz, 22.05kHz)
- Optional `rdp-audio` feature for audio playback via cpal (requires libasound2-dev)
- Bidirectional clipboard improvements for embedded RDP sessions

### Changed
- Updated MSRV to 1.87 (required by zune-jpeg 0.5.8)
- Updated dependencies: tempfile 3.24, criterion 0.8, cpal 0.17

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- Zero Trust: Improved UI by hiding irrelevant fields (Host, Port, Username, Password, Tags) when Zero Trust protocol is selected.

### Changed
- Upgraded `ironrdp` to version 0.13 (async API support).
- Refactored `rustconn-core` to improve code organization and maintainability.
- Made `spice-embedded` feature mandatory for better integration.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-23

### Changed
- Code cleanup: fixed all Clippy warnings (pedantic, nursery)
- Applied rustfmt formatting across all crates
- Added Deactivation-Reactivation sequence handling for RDP sessions

### Fixed
- Removed sensitive clipboard debug logging (security improvement)
- Fixed nested if statements and match patterns in RDPDR module

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- IronRDP clipboard integration for embedded RDP sessions (bidirectional copy/paste)
- IronRDP shared folders (RDPDR) support for embedded RDP sessions
- RemoteFX codec support for better RDP image quality
- RDPSND channel (required for RDPDR per MS-RDPEFS spec)

### Changed
- Migrated IronRDP dependencies from GitHub to crates.io (version 0.11)
- Reduced verbose logging in RDPDR module (now uses tracing::debug/trace)

### Fixed
- Pinned sspi to 0.16.0 and picky to 7.0.0-rc.16 to avoid rand_core conflicts

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- Tree view state persistence (expanded/collapsed folders saved between sessions)
- Native format (.rcn) import/export with proper group hierarchy preservation

### Fixed
- RDP embedded mode window sizing now uses saved window geometry
- Sidebar reload now preserves expanded/collapsed state
- Group hierarchy correctly maintained during native format import

### Changed
- Dependencies updated:
  - `ksni` 0.2 → 0.3 (with blocking feature)
  - `resvg` 0.44 → 0.45
  - `dirs` 5.0 → 6.0
  - `criterion` 0.5 → 0.6
- Migrated from deprecated `criterion::black_box` to `std::hint::black_box`

### Removed
- Removed obsolete TODO comment and unused variable in window.rs

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-01
