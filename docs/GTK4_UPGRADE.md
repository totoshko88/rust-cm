# GTK4 Upgrade Notes

## Version Upgrade Summary

RustConn has been upgraded to use the latest GTK4 Rust bindings:

| Component    | Previous | Current |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| gtk4 crate   | 0.9      | 0.10    |
| vte4 crate   | 0.8      | 0.9     |
| Feature flag | v4_12    | v4_14   |

## System Requirements

The application now requires GTK 4.14 or later to be installed on the system. Most modern Linux distributions (GNOME 46+, Fedora 40+, Ubuntu 24.04+) include GTK 4.14 or newer.

To check your GTK version:
```bash
pkg-config --modversion gtk4
```

## New Features Available in GTK 4.14

The upgrade enables access to several GTK 4.14 features that could improve the UI:

### AlertDialog Improvements
- `AlertDialog` (introduced in 4.10) provides a modern, async-friendly dialog API
- Better integration with async Rust patterns

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Improved accessibility support for screen readers
- Better ARIA-like semantics for widgets

### Graphics and Rendering
- Improved GPU rendering performance
- Better Wayland compositor integration
- Enhanced HiDPI support

### Widget Improvements
- `ColumnView` and `ListView` performance improvements
- Better touch and gesture support
- Improved drag-and-drop feedback

## Potential Future Enhancements

With GTK 4.14+ support, the following UI improvements could be implemented:

### 1. Modern Dialog Patterns
Replace traditional modal dialogs with `AlertDialog` for:
- Confirmation dialogs (delete connection, close unsaved)
- Error notifications
- Simple input prompts

### 2. Improved List Performance
Leverage `ColumnView` optimizations for:
- Large connection lists (100+ items)
- Search results display
- Session list views

### 3. Enhanced Drag-and-Drop
Use improved DnD APIs for:
- Better visual feedback during connection reordering
- Smoother animations
- Touch-friendly drag operations

### 4. Accessibility Improvements
- Add proper accessibility labels to all interactive elements
- Implement keyboard navigation for all dialogs
- Support screen reader announcements for state changes

### 5. Graphics Improvements
- Use GPU-accelerated rendering for terminal output
- Implement smooth scrolling in sidebar
- Add subtle animations for state transitions

## Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes
The upgrade from gtk4 0.9 to 0.10 is backward compatible. All existing code continues to work without modification.

### Deprecated APIs
No deprecated API warnings were found in the codebase. The application uses modern GTK4 patterns throughout.

### Testing
All 569 property-based tests and unit tests pass with the new dependencies.

## Building with GTK 4.20

For systems with GTK 4.20 installed (GNOME 49+), you can enable additional features by modifying `rustconn/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
gtk4 = { workspace = true, features = ["v4_20"] }
```

GTK 4.20 adds:
- Further accessibility improvements
- New widget features
- Performance optimizations

Note: This requires GTK 4.20 to be installed on the build system.
