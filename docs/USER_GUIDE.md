# RustConn User Guide

RustConn is a modern connection manager for Linux, designed to manage SSH, RDP, VNC, SPICE, and Zero Trust remote connections through a GTK4-based GUI with Wayland-native support. It supports custom console-based connections and integrates with secret managers (KeePassXC, libsecret). Import/export from Asbru-CM, Remmina, SSH config, and Ansible inventory.

## Performance Features

RustConn includes several performance optimizations designed to handle large connection databases efficiently.

### Search Caching

**Purpose:** Speed up repeated searches by caching results.

**How it works:**
- Search results are cached with a configurable TTL (default: 30 seconds)
- Repeated searches return cached results instantly
- Cache is automatically invalidated when connections are added, modified, or deleted
- Maximum 100 cached queries to prevent unbounded memory growth

**Behavior:**
- First search: Executes full search, caches results
- Repeated search within TTL: Returns cached results immediately
- After TTL expires: Re-executes search, updates cache

### Lazy Loading

**Purpose:** Reduce startup time for large connection databases.

**How it works:**
- Only root-level groups and ungrouped connections load at startup
- Child groups and connections load when you expand a parent group
- Loaded children remain in memory for quick re-expansion
- Search always searches all connections regardless of lazy loading state

**Benefits:**
- Faster application startup
- Lower initial memory usage
- Responsive UI even with thousands of connections

### Virtual Scrolling

**Purpose:** Maintain responsive scrolling with large connection lists.

**How it works:**
- Activates automatically when connection count exceeds 100
- Only renders visible items plus a small buffer (5 items above/below)
- Selection state is preserved when items scroll in and out of view
- Targets 60fps (16ms) scroll updates

**When to expect it:**
- Sidebar with 100+ connections
- Large search result sets

### Debounced Search

**Purpose:** Prevent excessive searches during rapid typing.

**How it works:**
- 100ms delay after you stop typing before search executes
- Each keystroke resets the timer
- Visual indicator shows when search is pending

**Benefits:**
- Smoother typing experience
- Reduced CPU usage during search
- More responsive UI

### Embedded SPICE Sessions

**Purpose:** View SPICE remote sessions directly in the application window.

**Requirements:**
- Requires `spice-client` crate (version 0.2.0) - included by default.

**Behavior:**
- SPICE connections open in embedded tabs (like SSH)
- Keyboard and mouse events are forwarded to the SPICE server
- If native connection fails, falls back to external `remote-viewer`

### ZeroTrust Connections

**Purpose:** Connect through cloud provider bastion services and zero-trust access platforms.

**Supported Providers:**
- **AWS SSM** - AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
- **GCP IAP** - Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy
- **Azure Bastion** - Azure Bastion service
- **Azure SSH** - Azure SSH extension
- **OCI Bastion** - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bastion
- **Cloudflare Access** - Cloudflare Zero Trust
- **Teleport** - Gravitational Teleport
- **Tailscale SSH** - Tailscale SSH
- **HashiCorp Boundary** - HashiCorp Boundary

**How to:**
1. Create new connection → Select "ZeroTrust" protocol
2. Choose provider from dropdown
3. Configure provider-specific settings (instance ID, project, etc.)
4. Save and connect

**Note:** Each provider requires its CLI tool to be installed and configured:
- AWS: `aws` CLI with SSM plugin
- GCP: `gcloud` CLI
- Azure: `az` CLI
- Tailscale: `tailscale` CLI

## Tracing and Debugging

RustConn uses structured logging via the `tracing` crate for diagnostics and performance profiling.

### Enabling Tracing

Set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable before starting RustConn:

```bash
# Basic info logging
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p rustconn

# Debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -p rustconn

# Trace logging (very verbose)
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run -p rustconn
```

### Module-Specific Logging

Target specific modules for focused debugging:

```bash
# Search operations
RUST_LOG=rustconn_core::search=debug cargo run -p rustconn

# Connection management
RUST_LOG=rustconn_core::connection=debug cargo run -p rustconn

# Credential resolution
RUST_LOG=rustconn_core::secret=debug cargo run -p rustconn

# Import/export operations
RUST_LOG=rustconn_core::import=debug,rustconn_core::export=debug cargo run -p rustconn

# Multiple modules
RUST_LOG=rustconn_core::search=trace,rustconn_core::connection=debug cargo run -p rustconn
```

### Traced Operations

The following operations include tracing spans with timing information:

- **Connection establishment**: Protocol, host, port, duration
- **Search execution**: Query, result count, cache hit/miss
- **Import/export**: Format, item count, progress
- **Credential resolution**: Backend used, success/failure

### Performance Profiling

For performance analysis, enable info-level logging to see operation timings:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p rustconn 2>&1 | grep -E "(span|duration)"
```

### Log Output

Logs are written to stderr by default. Redirect to a file for analysis:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -p rustconn 2> rustconn.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Fails

1. Verify host and port are correct
2. Check network connectivity
3. Verify credentials
4. Check firewall settings

### KeePass Integration Not Working

1. Ensure KeePassXC is installed
2. Enable browser integration in KeePassXC
3. Configure KDBX path in Settings → Secrets

### Terminal Not Responding

1. Check if connection is still active
2. Try pressing Enter
3. Close and reconnect
